# NeuralSynthesis: Evolving Neural Architectures with Differentiable Meta-Learning

NeuralSynthesis is a Rust-based project exploring the intersection of neural architecture search (NAS), differentiable meta-learning, hyperdimensional computing, and reservoir architectures. This project aims to develop a novel framework for automatically designing and optimizing neural networks with emergent properties, leveraging the power and efficiency of the Rust programming language. We focus on creating architectures that are not only performant but also exhibit desirable characteristics like robustness, interpretability, and energy efficiency.

This repository provides a comprehensive toolkit for researching and experimenting with evolving neural network architectures. The core idea is to represent neural architectures as differentiable computational graphs, allowing for gradient-based optimization of both network structure and weights. We integrate hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to encode and manipulate architectural blueprints, enabling efficient exploration of the design space. Furthermore, reservoir computing techniques are employed to foster emergent properties and enhance the system's adaptability to novel tasks. The ultimate goal is to create a self-improving NAS system that can discover novel and efficient neural network designs for a variety of applications.

NeuralSynthesis is designed to be highly modular and extensible, providing a foundation for researchers and practitioners to explore different aspects of neural architecture search. The codebase is structured to allow for easy integration of new search algorithms, encoding schemes, and evaluation metrics. The project emphasizes rigorous testing and documentation to ensure reproducibility and usability. We believe that NeuralSynthesis can contribute significantly to the advancement of automated machine learning and the discovery of innovative neural network architectures.

**Key Features**

*   **Differentiable Architecture Representation:** Implements a differentiable computational graph representation of neural network architectures, enabling gradient-based optimization of both structure and weights. This allows for continuous exploration and refinement of the architectural search space. The implementation utilizes custom Rust data structures and graph algorithms optimized for performance.
*   **Hyperdimensional Encoding:** Uses hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to encode architectural blueprints into high-dimensional vectors. This allows for efficient manipulation and comparison of different architectures. The HDC implementation includes methods for bundling, binding, and similarity calculation, enabling complex architectural transformations.
*   **Reservoir Computing Integration:** Incorporates reservoir computing techniques to foster emergent properties and enhance the system's adaptability. The reservoir component is implemented as a recurrent neural network with fixed weights, allowing for efficient processing of sequential data and the extraction of complex features.
*   **Meta-Learning Optimization:** Employs differentiable meta-learning algorithms to optimize the search process itself. This allows the system to learn from its past experiences and improve its ability to discover novel and efficient architectures. The meta-learning implementation uses techniques like Reptile and MAML to train a meta-optimizer.
*   **Parallel Execution:** Leverages Rust's concurrency features to enable parallel execution of architecture evaluation and optimization steps. This significantly reduces the time required to search for optimal architectures. The parallelization is achieved using Rust's `rayon` crate for data parallelism.
*   **Customizable Search Space:** Provides a flexible framework for defining the architectural search space, allowing users to specify the types of layers, connections, and hyperparameters that can be explored. The search space definition is implemented using a declarative configuration format.
*   **Modular Design:** Emphasizes modularity and extensibility, allowing for easy integration of new search algorithms, encoding schemes, and evaluation metrics. The codebase is structured using Rust's module system and trait system to promote code reusability and maintainability.

**Technology Stack**

*   **Rust:** The core programming language, chosen for its performance, safety, and concurrency features.
*   **TensorFlow (via Rust bindings):** Used for differentiable programming and gradient-based optimization. We leverage the `tensorflow` crate to interact with TensorFlow's computational graph execution engine.
*   **Rayon:** A data parallelism library for Rust, used to accelerate architecture evaluation and optimization.
*   **Serde:** A serialization/deserialization framework for Rust, used for configuration and data persistence.
*   **Log:** A logging facade for Rust, used for debugging and monitoring the search process.

**Installation**

1.  Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. You can install them by following the instructions on the official Rust website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/NeuralSynthesis
    cd NeuralSynthesis
3.  Install system dependencies for TensorFlow (if not already installed). Refer to the TensorFlow documentation for specific installation instructions for your operating system.
4.  Build the project:
    cargo build --release

**Configuration**

NeuralSynthesis uses environment variables for configuration. Here are some key environment variables:

*   `NEURALSYNTHESIS_SEARCH_SPACE_PATH`: Path to the search space configuration file (e.g., `config/search_space.toml`).
*   `NEURALSYNTHESIS_OUTPUT_DIR`: Directory where the results of the search process will be stored (e.g., `output`).
*   `NEURALSYNTHESIS_LEARNING_RATE`: Learning rate for the meta-optimizer (e.g., `0.001`).
*   `NEURALSYNTHESIS_NUM_ITERATIONS`: Number of search iterations to perform (e.g., `1000`).

These variables can be set in your shell environment before running the program. You can also create a `.env` file in the project root directory and load it using a library like `dotenv`.

**Usage**

To run the NeuralSynthesis project, execute the following command:

cargo run --release -- <arguments>

where `<arguments>` can include:

*   `--config <path>`: Specifies the path to the main configuration file. If not provided, defaults will be used.
*   `--mode <search|evaluate>`: Chooses the operation mode (either searching for new architectures or evaluating an existing one).

Example usage:

cargo run --release -- --config config/main.toml --mode search

API documentation will be provided in a separate document as the project matures.
